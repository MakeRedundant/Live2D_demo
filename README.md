# Live2D Project
This is my first project using Live2D Models based on Cubism SDK 2.1 and Cubism SDK 4, which supports all live2d model including model3

## 📄 Description 
Live2D models are animated 2D characters created using Live2D Cubism, a technology that allows artists to create dynamic animations from 2D illustrations. 

Model Creation: Artists create Live2D models using software like Live2D Cubism Editor. They draw and rig 2D artwork in layers, defining movement, expressions, and deformations.

Rigging and Parameterization: Artists use the Cubism Editor to set up parameters (such as eye blinking, facial expressions, etc.) and rig the model with bones and deformers to enable animation.

Animation Control: Live2D models are animated by manipulating the parameters created during rigging. Parameters control various aspects like movement, expressions, and interactions.

How Live2D Models Work:
Rendering: The SDK provides functionalities to render the Live2D models onto different platforms, like web browsers, mobile apps, games, etc.

Parameter Manipulation: By changing parameters like rotation, position, deformation, etc., the model's movements and expressions are controlled.

Interactivity: Developers can create interactions with the models—such as clicking, dragging, or triggering specific animations based on user input.

Integration: Live2D models can be integrated into various applications using the provided SDKs and APIs, allowing developers to bring these animated characters to life in their projects.

## 🖥️ Installation 

Users can run ```npm clone``` and beginning using the application. 

No backend is required
  
## 💬 Usage 
Put each model in a separate folder.
Cubism 2 model's entry file should be named ```model.json```  
Cubism 3/4 model's entry file should be named ```FolderName.model3.json.```

```dist/live2d_bundle.js``` is core file.
```waifu-tips.js``` contains configuration and implementation of message tips.
```waifu-tips.json``` contains content of message tips. Not required if you don't need message tips.
